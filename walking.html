              <h1 class="article-heading">The Key Exercise To Making Your Body Feel Better</h1>

              <p>What I'm about to say might make some people groan, and want to run away from the article because of how over-hyped, simple, and boring this activity can be, but there's good reason for the hype.</p>
              <p>Walking. I've tried all shapes and sizes of workouts that you can think of, not including the fancy machines at gyms because those and gyms scare me. I've played sports, jogging, jump rope, every variety of heavy dumbbell exercises, push ups, pull ups, sit ups, crunches, squats, weighted squats, wall sits, I've been through it all, and the majority of them I can no longer do.</p>
              <p>I work a very physical job thats lead to me having all sorts of joint injuries as time has gone off with never enough time off for them to heal properly which ends with me having to cross off another workout I can no longer do. I've now gotten to the point where walking is in fact one of the only ones left I can do, but there may be hope in the future <em>because</em> of walking. As a person with adhd, it's very easy to get stuck doing something like scrolling on social media, and no matter how bad you want to stop you just can't get yourself to. So, one day, I decided that if I was gonna be stuck scrolling, I might as well be stuck doing it while walking, or in this case, pacing around my room. For a long time I had ankle problems in thanks to work, and you would think that walking would make it worse wouldn't it? Well all that walking paid off because it actually healed my ankle! I had to wear icy-hot patches every day to work to help prevent further damage and ice my ankle on the extra bad days. This went on for months, but soon after I had started taking up walking, I noticed a quick difference just a few days in. As the next 2 or 3 weeks passed, I soon came to find myself with what seemed like a completely healed ankle.</p>
              <figure class="my-4">
                <img src="assets/img/fitness1-fotor-600-min.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                <figcaption></figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>When looking into the benefits of walking, I had come to learn that it's actually really good for your joints, which made my ankle make a lot more sense. The reason why walking is such a great exercise is because it offers such great benefits for your body at such a low cost. Sure you could get similar benefits from other cardio activities, but walking doesn't strain your joints and put you at risk the way the other ones do. In my mom's case, she loves to walk, but I recently had a conversation with her about how sometimes her knee hurts when she walks. I had remembered that while looking into the benefits of walking, I had also learned that walking backwards is suppose to be really good for your knees, so I had shared that information with my mom who started trying it out and was excited to report that she didn't have any pain while doing it. I've also found myself in the position where someway, somehow, my knee started hurting badly while pacing around in my room, so I took to going backwards instead and found instnant relief. </p>
              <p>One other major thing I witnessed as I had started to walk everyday was a huge boost in energy, almost an annoying amount. Because of my severe depression, I always feel unmotivated and tired, and that didn't change even with my new walking routing, however, while I felt terribly sluggish on the outside per usual, on the inside I was bursting with energy, to the point where I felt overstimulated and extremely uncomfortable because of it. This was especially annoying for me because again, while I had all of that going on the inside, on the outside I was in <em><strong>no</strong></em> mood to move an inch of my body more than I had to. All this extra energy could prove to be extremely problematic on my days off from work. I would want to take those days completely for myself which means no walking either because it does feel like a chore to me, but if I didn't get at least 10k steps in for the day I would not be able to get a decent night of sleep in thanks to the discomfort of the excess energy. In my case it was only a problem because of the way my depression effects me, but if that wasn't something I had to deal with, I can't imagine what I'd be able to accomplish in terms of physical activity throughout the day because of that extra energy. </p>
