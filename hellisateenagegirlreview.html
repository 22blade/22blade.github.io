              <h1 class="article-heading">Hell Is A Teenage Girl, Album Review and Ranking</h1>

              <p>Nessa Barrett's 2nd EP, "Hell Is A Teenage Girl," starts off with the titular track, the track goes on to speak the experiences a young women face navigating the transition between teenage years and adulthood in a world where toxic masculinity runs wild and has become something that laregely effects that transition. The track has a dark taste to it in true Nessa Barrett fashion. One of my personal favorite parts of this track are after the first chorus there's a beat that comes into play that's just absolute perfection but the part that really drives me crazy is after the 2nd chorus when what sounds like stringed intstruments like violins/cellos errupt into the song turning it into a true experience, only to be followed up with a brdige that features a more stripped down moment of Barrett's voice that leaves you feeling almost hypnotic.</p>
              <p>Track 2, "the one that should've got away" isntantly captures the attention of the listener with an off-putting piano playing mismatched keys, only for that piano to break into beautifully despairing chords. The overall tone is very much so modern-noire (Think "skyfall" by Adele). While I don't feel like there's anything especially complex about the lyrcis, the way those lyrics are sung carry the story in a way that words couldn't do justice, the chorus does something really interesting with the melody that I can't even begin to explainr really, but it's just so... cool? For lack of a more professional, smarter sounding word. After jumping into the 2nd verse of the song the piano is now joined by a guitar that blends in perfectly with the despairing sound of the song and pushes the story to a whole other level. In the bridge, Nessa interupts her own singing with a sing-talk bit before errupting into a musical solo of that cool sound we were talking about earlier. The track is easily a top contender for best track on the album, and has to be one of the coolest song I've heard all year.</p>
              <p>Track 3, "lie," one of the singles off the EP. Despite it seeming like a slower song, I find the song to be a  lot of fun to listen to and (in the least offensive way possible) catchy. The melody and singing seems so sweet, but the lyrics are much more bitter creaitng a perfect bittersweet harmony. While I can't find many words for this one, I would also consider it a top contender because it's another one of those tracks that's just so cool, which I'm starting to think is going to be my new top associated word for Ms. Nessa.</p>
              <p>Track 4, "plane to paris" We return to our regularly scheduled programming of absolute heartwrenching beauitful piano despair. Oh. My. God. This is without a doubt going to be the top track. I didn't think there was going to be one cooler than "the one that should've got away," but I need everyone in the world to listen to this song right now. Those harmonized "hmms," or whatever the hell they are just. I have no words. The combination of those harmonies, the piano, the melody she sings, the lyrics, everything is just one big life-ruining, pure devastation. If depression was a song, this would be it. The song refers to a plane as a "doomsday comet," which I don't think I need to explain why this is one of the things I'm bringing up. The track ends with fittingly beautiful french spoken, and then cuts to a devastating announcement from the plane's captain. If I had the power to put any song I want in song of the year at the grammys, I would put this one in, in a heartbeat, and I hate that it's unlikely such a beautiful song willl reach the amount of listeners it deserves.</p>
              <p>Track 5, "heatbreak in the hamptons." In this track we get a bit more upbeat, and it holds that ideal anti-pop, dark, somewhat sultry sound to it. At first I wasn't a big fan of the chorus, I felt it was a little plain in comparison to all the cool trick we've heard from Barrett this far, but in the 2nd half of the chorus, she switches it up a bit with a lighter sound in her voice which really turned it around for me. The bridge/outro has that cool, lana-del-ray vibe to it which also really did a lot for me. Definitely not a bad track at all, but in comparison to the tracks we've already heard (especially following plane to pairs), it feels weaker than it would if it was by itself.</p>
              <p>Track 6, "american jesus," another single off the EP, this one I can't say much about besides the lana-del-ray vibes again and that I was streaming this one 24/7 when it finally dropped. Iconic. Makes me feel religious except not actually.</p>
              <p>Track 7, "motel whore," The combination of the guitars and Nessa's vocals in this one gives me heavy arctic monkeys vibes. The story behind the song itself is very captivating, but the song itself is very slow with a very simple instrumental side and a very simple melody, in comparison to the rest of the EP I would say this is the weakest link.</p>
              <p>Track 8, "BANG BANG!" Another single off the EP, I wouldn't know how to categorize the sound of this song in the slightest. It's very unique, a lot of cool stylistic choices throughout the entire song, the vibe is very iconic. I'd say it's in a similar boat to "heartbreak in the hamptons," where in comparison to the rest of the album it's on the weaker side, but as a stand alone song it's a ton of fun to jam out to.</p>

              <p>Deciding the overall album ranking for this one was very tough, there was some really amazing songs on it that made me want to give it a 10, but there were also a few who's gap in strength between those monster songs was just a bit took far for me to stay in the experience the album was creating and sort of just took me out of it, because of this I wouldl give it's overall ranking a 9/10</p>
