              <h1 class="article-heading">Guts - Olivia Rodrigo, Album Review and Ranking</h1>

              <p>The album's first track has a deceivingly slow start before it explodes in something reminiscent of the early 2000s punk. The track is filled with clever and punch lyrics, perfectly placed and not overused profranity, and a unique style choice in adding in what others have described as a "lowercase scream," this track is the eptiomy of 2000s nostalgia for those that grew up on Avril Lavigne and Lindsay Lohan's Freaky Friday. Overall I'd say it was a strong opening for the singer's sophomore album and a great track. </p>
              <p>The album then turns into the two singles we're already familiar with, the cheeky, fun, and edgy "Bad Idea," and the soul-baring, ballad of a tragic story, "Vampire". I found it interesting that she placed the two singles right at the start because it leaves the rest of album one big question mark, it could go anywhere from there, which could be a rather risky decision if the rest of the tracks weren't as strong, as I've seen many albums be a let down in comparison to the singles they released from it, however for Olivia, this risk paid off in spades because of the greatness that comes from the rest of the tracks on the album. Doing this really allows the listener to focus on the real story and journey of the album for what it is rather than be overly caught up in the familarity and stories of the two singles.</p>
              <p>From here we enter the uncharted territory and see what direction the album is really going since each track so far has had such a different sound from the other. "lacy" takes us in an interesting direction because despite the beautiful and softness we witness from the musical aspect of the song, the lyrics can, at times, feel poisonous as they overflow with jealousy, bitterness, and spite, none of which by any means is a bad thing. At other times, through the poison, you can see and almost feel the pain behind all the negative emotions. The track itself is slow paced and features beautiful harmonies, but I believe the real strength in the track is the lyrics/story, as it's full of a lot of complex emotions and the holds a lot more meaning on a deeper level than the lyrics show on the surface.</p>
              <p>After "lacy," "balld of a homeschooled girl," does a full 180 and takes us straight back to that 2000s punk sound we first heard in the opening track and may just be the most relatable song Olivia has made to date. The song is every bit just as fun and upbeat as "all-american bitch," but, like "lacy," the most fun part of the song is the lyrics. The song is exactly what the title claims to be, and is for all the socially awkward folks out there and anyone else who struggles with social cues, the song makes you feel seen in a comforting way and even a little bit proud of your social ineptness when you think about how one of the biggest pop stars today is the same way and makes a song out of it that makes it feel iconic rather than loser-ish </p>
              <p>We now switch back to the softer side of Olivia's sound with "making the bed," and "logical." "making the bed," is arguable one of the best tracks off the album, while it's approach is something closer to a ballad, there's still a certain up-beatness to the tempo that makes it feel less so like you're listening to a slow ballad, the vocal effects make you feel like you're listening to something holy or angelic, the short music solo it features in the bridge really draws you in to the crushing feeling the song emits and gives you a moment to just float with those emotions which then pushes into a stripped down piano and brings every depressing emotion you were just feeling into overdrive to the point where you just feel devastating heartbreak. "logical," seems to be rather simple in terms of the musical aspect throughout the majority of the song, but the bridge breaks the pattern of that and switches into an almost acapella style as Olivia belts away the heartbreaking lyrics and ties the whole song together.</p>
              <p>Similarly to how Olivia gave us the two softer songs, she then jumps right back into 2 of her unique up-beat tracks "get him back!," and "love is embarassing." "get him back!," is definitely one of those songs on an album that everyone knows should've been a single, but it's also clear why it wasn't, because even though the album has had a ton of other single-worthy tracks, it's always a lot more fun to leave a track like this for the album. I would consider the track to be the sister song of "bad idea right?," because it's every bit as cheeky and fun, and has the perfect bridge to scream in a car. "love is embarassing" was something I consider a hidden gem or diamond in the rough on this album. Because of how much the other tracks have drawn you in, by the time you reach this song in the album it's easy to let it go over your head as nothing special, but when you really pay attention to the song, it's easy to notice how good it actually is. Despite it being upbeat, the song itself feels nothing like the other upbeat tracks on the album and feels like it's in it's own lane. "love is emabrassing," feels like the kind of song you see in a fun movie montage or that you'd hear in roller rink, the song is the epitome of having a blast, which is why I can see this track being one of the top tracks for the album.</p>
              <p>"the grudge," is another one of my top contenders for best track on the album, the story telilng in this one is what I believe to the be the strongest out of the rest of the tracks on the album, there's a breif moment that seemingly mimicks the car sound from "drivers license" and the piano and string combination blends together for perfect devastation. We see another perfect scream in the car bridge however the one we see in "get him back!," was more of a "deja-vu" type of car-scream-brdige, while "the grudge," is more of a "drivers license," car-scream-bridge. </p>
              <p>"pretty isn't pretty," reminds me a bit of "love is embarassing," in the sense that it's a diamon in the rough. Because of it's position in the album, it's easy to overlook it, but in reality, the track itself has a beautiful and unique sound. It's one of those tracks that feels fun and sad at the same time, it's upbeat yet mellow. I would consider it and "wish you were sober," by Conan Gray to be the ultimate examples of bed-room pop, and voices a struggle that millions go through which typically never gets better.</p>
              <p>We close out the album with the final track, "teenage dream," which is a ballad about the unspoken struggles of being a teenager that often gets overlooked by adults because it's coming from a "kid." Despite the beauty or fun we've heard from some of the other bridges across the album, I truly believe that this track has the best bridge of the album, and is one of Olivia's greatest bridges of all times despite the simplicity of it repeating the one line "they all say that it gets better," it's done in a beautiful way starting off with what sounds like layers of Olivia's voice in a soft and sad sound which then bursts into a climactic, loud, and passionate harmony still repeating the line which many people, not just teenagers, have heard and struggled with. "they all say that it gets better but what if I don't," is a heartbreaking thought that haunts the minds of many across all sorts of ages, races, genders, etc. The album starts from such a fun, punchy place and ends leaving you shattered and left to pick up the pieces in a puddle all alone.</p>

              </figure>
              <p>The sophomore album broke all expectations and can easily be placed at a 10/10. Not a single track disappointed, and can easily be called a no-skip album so the track ranking shouldn't be taken too seriously.</p>
